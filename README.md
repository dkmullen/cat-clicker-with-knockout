# Cat Clicker Project (using knockout.js)
Class assignment for Udacity
## Description
A simple web site that displays a list of cats along with one cat picture at a time, and records clicks. The learning objective is to solve design and execution problems with Javascript and to organize the code with knockout.js as an organizing framework.

The app runs from `cat-clicker.html` accesses `js/cat.js` and makes use of Knockout (`knockout-3.4.0.js`) to bind functions to the html and make the js simpler.
## Install the project
Clone this repository. Run the project by opening the `.html` file. Find the `.js` file in the `js` directory.
